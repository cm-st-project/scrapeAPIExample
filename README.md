# scrapeAPIExample

This Repository shows how to use the Pandas library to process data retrieved from Twitter using the ScrapeAPI service. It queries Twitter for tweets related to the keyword "bitcoin" and fetches the top 3 tweets from the past 1 day (1D). The fetched data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
